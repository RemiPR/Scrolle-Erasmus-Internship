      Biography:
    </h3>
    <p class="mt-4 text-justify text-gray-800 tracking-wide">
      Carla Heelan is a historian of modern Europe, with a particular focus on
      the cultural history of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Germany. Her
      current book project explores the importance of historical myths for
      modern nationalism. From 1815 to 1945, certain moments from German history
      became essential to the creation of a sense of modern national belonging,
      and narratives about the supposed origins of Germany during the Middle
      Ages were especially important for debates about citizenship, progress,
      and modernity.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-justify text-gray-800 tracking-wide">
      Carla has presented and taught extensively on these themes, as well as on
      broader topics of modern European history, including industrialization,
      urbanization, the creation of party politics, and the global dimensions of
      modern European nationalism. She received her PhD from Harvard in 2016.
