      EU, EEA and Swiss citizens do not need to register with the Office of
      Citizenship and Migration Affairs (OCMA), but need only a valid travel
      document (passport or ID card) to enter Latvia, if: <br />students are
      admitted to an educational institution registered with the Register of
      Education Institutions of the Republic of Latvia; and the intended period
      of residence does not exceed one year (see: OCMA → Residence permits).
      <br /><br />Be aware that in certain cases a residence permit can be
      helpful, for example, for opening a bank account. For details on how to
      apply for a student residence permit as an EU citizen, please see OCMA
      information → Registration cards for students.
